# Brain Boosters Tutoring Platform

**Brain Boosters** is a community of passionate teachers who’ve come together to create an app that makes finding the perfect tutor simple and stress-free. Whether your child needs help catching up, preparing for exams, or just wants to explore a new subject, the goal of Brain Boosters is to connect parents with experienced tutors nearby. It’s all about bringing quality education closer to home and making learning accessible, personal, and effective for every family.

Right now, parents and tutors have to go through Brain Boosters to connect, either by phone or in person. We do not have an online presence. We want to make things simpler and more convenient for everyone. We need a system that lets parents connect with tutors anytime, from anywhere, and book sessions directly—no middleman involved. Our goal is to give families the flexibility to schedule tutoring sessions on their own terms while making our services accessible to even more users.

We aim to cut down incoming calls by **50%** by making our platform easily accessible to users, while also boosting community engagement by **15%** within the first year.
