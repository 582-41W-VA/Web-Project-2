# Brain Boosters Tutoring Platform Proposal

## Team
A team of 5 developers is working together to bring the Brain Boosters online platform to life. Here's what everyone is contributing:

- **Evgenia**: Taking charge of the UX/UI design to make sure the platform is user-friendly and visually appealing.
- **Carlo**: Handling the front-end development, focusing on HTML and CSS to bring the designs to life.
- **Linlin and Kemin**: Building the back-end structure of the website to ensure it is functional and runs smoothly.
- **Helena**: Jumping in wherever needed, assisting all developers, and completing tasks as required. She’s also managing the GitHub repository to keep tasks and project documents organized.

## Users
Brain Boosters tutoring services are mainly designed for school-aged kids between 5 and 18 years old. That said, adults like tutors and parents will also be key users of the platform. Most of the activity is expected to come from users aged 20 to 60. Tutors will use the platform to set up their profiles and connect with parents nearby to schedule sessions. Parents, on the other hand, can easily browse and book tutors without needing to create a profile themselves.

## Technologies

### Django
We will be using Django for the development of the back-end structure for this project. Django’s built-in tools will make it easy to quickly build this platform. It integrates well with third-party services like Google Maps and PayPal which we will need for this project. It also has excellent documentation meaning developers have access to plenty of resources to handle any development challenges.

### React
We will be using React for the development of the front-end of this project. React will allow us to break down the UI into reusable components. For example, we can have reusable components for tutor profiles, session booking forms, or search filters, making the development process more efficient.

React can also be easily integrated with Django for handling front-end and back-end separately. This allows for a smooth development process where Django takes care of the back-end, while React focuses on rendering dynamic content and managing the user interface.
